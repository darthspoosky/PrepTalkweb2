This plan outlines the steps for implementing the PrepTalk Lite mobile app based on the provided design specification.

### I. Project Setup

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Install Flutter SDK and necessary IDE extensions (VS Code/Android Studio).
    *   Set up version control (Git) with a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    *   Configure project structure following Flutter best practices.
    *   Define project dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` (state management, animation, 3D rendering, UI components, etc.). Dependencies like `flutter_bloc`, `go_router`, `dio`, `freezed`, `json_serializable` and `flutter_screenutil` have been added.
    * Note: The directory structure (lib/core, lib/features, lib/shared, and subdirectories for features) needs to be created manually, including the lib/app.dart file.

2.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   Create a new Flutter project.
    *   Implement a basic navigation structure (e.g., using `flutter_bloc` and `go_router`) for initial app flow.

    *   Define core app themes and styles (colors, typography) in a centralized location.

3.  **Team Collaboration:**
    *   Establish clear coding standards and style guides.
    *   Set up communication channels (e.g., Slack, Discord) for team coordination.
    *   Define sprint cycles and task assignments using a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello).

### II. UI/UX Implementation

1.  **Component Library:**
    *   Develop custom widgets for recurring UI elements (buttons, input fields, progress indicators, bento grid layouts, etc.) based on the design specification.
    *   Implement responsive layouts using `MediaQuery` and custom breakpoints to ensure consistent UI across different screen sizes and orientations.

2.  **Screen Development:**
    *   Implement each screen according to the design specification, focusing on visual fidelity and user interactions.
    *   Pay close attention to UI trends outlined in the specification (3D objects, AI interface elements, text transitions, progressive blur, modern skeuomorphism, etc.).
    *   Utilize animation frameworks (Rive, Flutter Animation) to create micro-interactions and transitions as specified.

3.  **User Flow Integration:**
    *   Connect individual screens to create the complete user flows described in the specification (onboarding, core learning loop, quiz experience, AI document analysis, performance review).
    *   Ensure smooth navigation and consistent state management between screens.

4.  **Accessibility Implementation:**
    *   Implement accessibility features as outlined in the specification (color contrast, text scaling, voice control, reduced motion, screen reader support, dark mode).
    *   Regularly test accessibility using screen readers and other assistive technologies.

### III. Core Functionality

1.  **Data Modeling:**
    *   Define data models for core entities (users, subjects, learning materials, quizzes, performance metrics, AI summaries, etc.).

2.  **Data Persistence:**
    *   Choose a data persistence solution (e.g., local database using SQLite or Hive, cloud-based storage with Firebase or Supabase).
    *   Implement data storage and retrieval mechanisms for user data, learning progress, and other relevant information.

3.  **Learning Material Management:**
    *   Implement functionality for browsing, accessing, and interacting with learning materials.
    *   Integrate features like page-turning animations, text highlighting, and margin notes.

4.  **Quiz Functionality:**
    *   Develop the quiz engine, including question management, answer submission, instant feedback, progress tracking, and performance summary.
    *   Implement features like progressive question difficulty and interactive answer selection.

5.  **Performance Tracking:**
    *   Implement mechanisms for tracking user performance, including quiz scores, learning progress, and time spent studying.
    *   Develop visualizations for performance analytics, such as 3D charts and interactive timelines.

### IV. AI Integration

1.  **API Integration (if applicable):**
    *   Identify and integrate with any necessary APIs for AI functionalities (e.g., document summarization, key concept extraction, personalized recommendations).
    *   Implement error handling and data parsing for API responses.

2.  **AI Document Analysis:**
    *   Implement the document upload and processing flow, including visual feedback during AI processing.
    *   Integrate the AI summarization and key concept extraction functionalities.
    *   Develop features for flashcard generation and study material integration.

3.  **Personalized Recommendations:**
    *   Implement algorithms or integrate with recommendation systems to provide personalized study recommendations based on user performance and learning goals.

4.  **AI Presence Indicators:**
    *   Visually integrate AI presence indicators (e.g., gradient animations, color shifts, transparent labeling) to clearly identify AI-powered features.

### V. Testing

1.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for individual functions and components to ensure code correctness and reliability.
    *   Focus on testing core logic, data manipulation, and UI component behavior.

2.  **Widget Testing:**
    *   Create widget tests to verify the UI rendering and interaction of individual widgets and screens.
    *   Ensure that widgets behave as expected and respond correctly to user input.

3.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Develop integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the app, such as navigation between screens and data flow between components.

4.  **UI/UX Testing:**
    *   Conduct user testing sessions with high-fidelity prototypes or early builds of the app.
    *   Gather feedback on usability, visual design, and overall user experience.

5.  **Performance Testing:**
    *   Test the app's performance on different devices and network conditions.
    *   Identify and address any performance bottlenecks or areas for optimization.

6.  **Accessibility Testing:**
    *   Thoroughly test the app's accessibility features using screen readers and other assistive technologies.
    *   Ensure that the app is usable by individuals with disabilities.

7.  **A/B Testing (Optional):**
    *   Conduct A/B tests on different UI/UX variations to optimize key interactions and improve user engagement.

### VI. Deployment

1.  **App Store Preparation:**
    *   Create developer accounts for the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android).
    *   Prepare app metadata, including app name, description, screenshots, and promotional materials.

2.  **Build and Release:**
    *   Generate release builds of the app for both iOS and Android platforms.
    *   Follow platform-specific guidelines for submitting the app for review.

3.  **Beta Testing (Optional):**
    *   Distribute beta versions of the app to a limited group of users for final testing and feedback.

4.  **App Store Submission:**
    *   Submit the app for review by Apple and Google.
    *   Address any issues or feedback raised during the review process.

5.  **Launch and Monitoring:**
    *   Once approved, release the app to the App Store and Google Play Store.
    *   Monitor app performance, user feedback, and crash reports.
    *   Plan for ongoing updates and improvements based on user data and feedback.
